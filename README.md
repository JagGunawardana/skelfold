# skelfold
A mix between a skeleton generator and scaffold generator be able to provide options and generate boiler plate code, with the option to regenerate and incorporate changes later. Typically we would use this for creating a template for (micro) service for the following reasons/scenarios:

- For generating a bare bones starting point and enforcing standards;
- Updating a service when improvements are made to the supporting code;

# How it works

You bind your templates in with the binary. You then just distribute the binary.
